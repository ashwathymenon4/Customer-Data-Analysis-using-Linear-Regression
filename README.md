# Customer-Data-Analysis-using-Linear-Regression (Python for Data Science and Machine Learning BootCamp Udemy)
The project conducts customer data analysis on website and mobile app usage to determine whether the company should focus their efforts on mobile app experience or their website.

## Scenario
You just got some contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. They've hired you on contract to help them figure it out! Let's get started!

**Note**: The customer data used here is fake and is just a sample data.

## Data Source
* Ecommerce Customers csv file.
* It has Customer info, suchas Email, Address, and their color Avatar.
* Then it also has numerical value columns:
  * Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
  * Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
  * Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
  * Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.
  
## Analysis and Visualization
The project code contains visualization outputs and analysis.

## Conclusion
There are two ways to think about this: Develop the Website to catch up to the performance of the mobile app, or develop the app more since that is what is working better. This sort of answer really depends on the other factors going on at the company, you would probably want to explore the relationship between Length of Membership and the App or the Website before coming to a conclusion!
